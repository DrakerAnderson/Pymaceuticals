## I worked to clean and merge data to produce plots for information on drug regimens being tested on mice.

# Project Requirements
This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:
  - Prepare the data.
  - Generate summary statistics.
  - Create bar charts and pie charts.
  - Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
  - Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
  - Calculate correlation and regression.
  - Submit your final analysis. 

# Visualizations
## The project includes a range of visualizations, including:
  - bar charts showing Mouse ID and Timepoints for drug regimens
  - Pie charts showing ratio between male and female mice
  - Box plots showing tumor distribution by treatment groups
  - Line plots showing treatments for a mouse on a specific drug
  - Scatter plots showing treatments for all mice on the specified drug

# Technical Details
  - Dependencies: Python 3.0 or better, with an environment containing Pandas, seaborn, matplot.lib, pathlib, glob, os and datetime dependencies.

# DATA SOURCES: 
  = Starter code from bootcamp module page for project 5
